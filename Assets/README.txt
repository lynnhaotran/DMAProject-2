Project 2: Tech Tycoon
By: Lynn Hao Tran (304-325-447)

Controls
Arrow keys to move left and right, sometimes also up and down, depending on the mini-game
Mouse clicks when prompted
Space bar down when prompted

Notes
The levels are unbounded, so the player *can* disappear off the screen.
The GUI has hardcoded values for where they display, so for best playthrough it would
be recommended playing fullscreen, though different screen resolutions may alter the 
placement of some text.

Enjoy! :)
